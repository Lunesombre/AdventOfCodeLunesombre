# Advent of Code - Lunesombre

## Advent of Code 2024
 It's been a few years that I'm interested in the Advent of code but don't have the time to try it.

 This year, I still don't have time, but I will give it a shot nonetheless! 

I made a small "in console" app in Java/SpringBoot so I can choose a year and day, and get the puzzles' result in the console, as long as I have already made the solver

- 2024
  - day 1 : solved ğŸ˜Š
  - day 2 : solved ğŸ˜„
  - day 3 : solved #regex ğŸ˜£
  - day 4 : solved ğŸ¤—
  - day 5 : solved ğŸ¥µ
  - day 6 : solved. Part 2 very slow though.
